# BOAST II - Python Implementation

Python conversion of BOAST II (Black Oil Applied Simulation Tool), a three-dimensional, three-phase (oil, gas, and water) black oil reservoir simulator originally developed in Fortran 77.

## Overview

BOAST II uses the IMPES (Implicit Pressure, Explicit Saturation) method to simulate oil reservoir behavior:
- **Implicit Pressure**: Solves pressure equations using numerical methods
- **Explicit Saturation**: Updates saturations based on calculated flow rates

### Original Source
- **Language**: Fortran 77
- **Release**: Version 1.2
- **Author**: J.R. Fanchi (April 1987)

6. **Update Saturations** (explicit)
   - Calculate saturation changes based on flow rates
   - Update oil, water, and gas saturations

## Key Features

## Development Notes

### Array Indexing
- **Fortran**: 1-based indexing
- **Python**: 0-based indexing
- Conversion requires careful index management

### Common Blocks
Fortran COMMON blocks converted to:
- Class attributes in `BOASTSimulator`
- Shared references passed between modules

### Data Structures
- Multi-dimensional arrays: `numpy` arrays
- Dynamic sizing based on input parameters
- Pre-allocated for performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Uniform pressure/saturation (no variation between blocks)  
**Cause**: Flow arrays not properly initialized  
**Solution**: Verify transmissibility and mobility calculations

**Issue**: Simulation hangs or runs very slowly  
**Cause**: Iterative solver not converging  
**Solution**: Check convergence parameters (omega, tolerance)

**Issue**: Array index errors  
**Cause**: 0-based vs 1-based indexing mismatch  
**Solution**: Review index conversions in specific routine
